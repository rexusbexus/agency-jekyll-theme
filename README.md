# How to publish a blogpost

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com). You can't publish blogposts if you don't have a GitHub account.
2. Create a **square image** for your blogpost and upload it in the [img/blog folder](img/blog). It should be minimum 400x400 and maximum 600x600 and less than 500 KB. The image filename should be in uncapitalized **[slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug)** format with the same name as your blogpost's title.
3. If you don't have an image, you can find a free licensed one in one of these websites: [unsplash](http://unsplash.com), [pexels](http://pexels.com), or [pixabay](http://pixabay.com).
4. The easiest way to crop your image into a square image is to use [this website](https://birme.net/). If you want to be creative and do some express photoshoping then [pixlr express](https://pixlr.com/express) is a good online app.
5. Create a .markdown in the [\_posts folder](_posts). The filename should be in uncapitalized **[slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug)** format with the following pattern: _YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-blogpost.markdown_. 
6. Are you sure you used a slug when naming both your blogpost image file and blogpost .markdown file? If you still don't know what a slug is then just [use this](https://blog.tersmitten.nl/slugify/).
7. There are a bunch of properties you need to set values to, they are: title, subtitle, layout, modal-id, date, pretty-date, img, thumbnail, author, and author-url. Make sure you set them correctly, look at [past](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexusbexus/tubular/gh-pages/_posts/2018-04-03-first-post.markdown) [posts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rexusbexus/tubular/gh-pages/_posts/2018-04-04-microblogging.markdown) as a reference.
8. Now's the time to write your blogpost. Keep it short and succinct! You're entitled to up to four paragraphs by using the following properties: post-par1, post-par2, post-par3, and post-par4.
9. **IMPORTANT:** Don't use the ":" character in your text or it will break the post.
