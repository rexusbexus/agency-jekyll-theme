# What is TUBULAR?
Supporting climate change research from the edge of space!

## Objective
Support climate change research with a cost-effective and re-usable high altitude balloon air sampling system that reduces the current complexities and limitations of obtaining air samples for stratospheric greenhouse gas distribution analysis.

## Motivation
The idea for the experiment stems from concerns over the realities of climate change as a result of human activity coupled with the complexity and limitations of obtaining much needed greenhouse gas profile data to better understand the issue.

## Solution
The Alternative to AirCore (AAC) sampling system will be launched as a proof-of-concept and its reliability will be validated against the samples collected by a proven AirCore sampling system that will also be part of the payload.

Project TUBULAR was implemented under the REXUS/BEXUS programme which is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden.

# Acknowledgement
The TUBULAR Team wishes to acknowledge the invaluable support received by the REXUS/BEXUS organizers: Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA), German Aerospace Center (DLR), European Space Agency (ESA), Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM), Esrange Space Centre, and ESA Education. In particular, the team's gratitude extends to the following project advisers who showed special interest in our experiment and its success: Dr. Rigel Kivi (Finnish Meteorological Institute – FMI), Mr. Pauli Heikkinen (FMI), Dr. Thomas Kuhn (Luleå University of Technology – LTU), Mr. Olle Persson (LTU), Mr. Grzegorz Izworski (ESA), Mr. Koen Debeule (ESA), Dr. Uwe Raffalski (Swedish Institute of Space Physics – IRF), and Mr. Vincent Still (LTU Alumni). The team would also like to acknowledge sponsorship from manufacturers and suppliers whom showed authentic interest in the experiment as well as providing high performance components and outstanding support: Restek, SMC Pneumatics, SilcoTek, Swagelok Sweden, Teknolab Sorbent, Lagers Masking Consulting, Bosch Rexroth, KNF, and Eurocircuits. From these sponsors, the team is particularly grateful to Dr. Hansjoerg Majer (Restek), David Bengtsson (SMC), Fleming P. Dambo (SMC), Marcus Rydstedt (SMC), René Unglauben (SilcoTek), Fredrik Andersson (Swagelok Sweden), Thomas Norin (Teknolab Sorbent), and Magnus Roman (Teknolab Sorbent).
