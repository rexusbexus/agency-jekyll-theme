post-par1: Hello again, good readers! Twelve days sure pass by quickly, don’t they? Last Tuesday, I left Kiruna to return to civilization to finally get started on my own recharging. I’m writing from Vienna, Austria, where there are plenty of green parks mixed in between the dense urban areas! After tending to a few of my tasks for SED v3.0, I decided to go for a bike ride out along the Danube river! It definitely was one of those feelings you simply can’t get enough of when you find yourself otherwise intensely involved in large projects - especially those involving many people!

post-par2: So, with many of us now scattered back across the globe as we were prior to BEXUS, communication becomes of the utmost importance! Trouble is, it is also the easiest thing to forget when you find yourself suddenly not living in the area you’ve always associated with BEXUS work (Kiruna), and instead find yourself in the area you associate with chilling out over the summer! (I am from Bulgaria originally, but I have immediate family living here, so Vienna is pretty much “home” for me.) In spite of that, I finally made it a point today to read every message that had been sent over our group chat since my departure, and noted the feedback documents we received following the CDR presentation made by my colleagues - to know what to do next in improving the SED as a response to said feedback! For me, it’s mostly going to be checking if certain document sections drag on for too long over minute technological or scientific details that may be better suited to go in their respective appendices. Other than that, it’s mostly more updates to thermal properties! Yay!

post-par3: What I do know is that I will be off the grid from the 20th until the first of July, but with my next blogpost day falling within that time frame, I guess I will still need to bring a laptop!
