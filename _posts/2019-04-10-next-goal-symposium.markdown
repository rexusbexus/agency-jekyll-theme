post-par1: Hello, Erik is back again after a long break! So you must be wondering by now what is happening with the TUBULAR team.

post-par2: After the launch and a handing in our SED version 5 we have had some more relaxing time, fixing for the re-flight planning when it is gonna happen. We are super excited that FMI is considering another flight just for us and the only thing left is to to find good winds for a launch day.

post-par3: Now the amazing part, we have been invited by ESA to present our experiment at the 24th ESA Symposium on European Rocket and Balloon Programmes and related Research. To prepare for it, I have been working on a brand new poster that we can bring with us and also a presentation to tell the people attending all about TUBULAR and our achievements.

post-par4: If you are interested to follow us at the symposium we shall try publish some on our facebook page to keep everyone updated when we are in Essen, and if you have not read the SED v5.0 yet, go in and read it or at least the result to see the good work done by all of the TUBULAR team.
