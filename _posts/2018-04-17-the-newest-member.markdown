post-par1: Stop waiting for things to happen, go and make them happen! Thus today’s post will be written by one of the freshly joined member of the TUBULAR team. You got it right, if you may already guessed who I am. Our Project Manager Georger’s post from few days ago already mentioned me along with another crew. If you missed it, fear not, because from now on you will be reading many posts by me, Emily Chen.
post-par2: I’m a part of the mechanical team and have joined for approximately 11 days ago. I may hold the record for least days joined in this group, but I will certainly give my best performance. My mainly task at the moment is focusing on the conventional AirCore, CAC, which is similar as the lungs in this experiment. Another task is, alternative AirCore, AAC, which consists the sampling bags.
post-par3: They both have the same function; collecting air at different altitudes in the lower stratosphere. The CAC consists a 300m long stainless steel tube, combining a 200m of 3.175 mm tube and a 100m of 6.35 mm tube, with a valve mounted at each end. During the experiment, one of these valves will be mainly closed. While the second one will stay open for a longer period of time, in order to flush the initial gas in the tube. It will also be intaking of air samples.  
post-par4: As of now, we in the mechanical team are deeming all the components for both the CAC and AAC, in order to get all the necessary parts. At the same time we also need to finalizing the schematic models for both the AirCore systems. Our next step is to build a simple model as soon as possible in order to launch the testing phase.
