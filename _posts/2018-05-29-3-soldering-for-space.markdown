post-par1: Welcome to blog number three of today! This blog brought to you from the exotic location of Leiden, The Netherlands, where its been a balmy 31 degrees and the chances of being run over by a bike have never been higher.

post-par2: So I have gone to ESTEC ahead of the rest of the team to take part in the BEXUS soldering course. This lasted for two days and we learnt about through hole, surface mounting and wire soldering as well as crimping and cable connections. We learnt not only how these should look but also how to make these flight ready, meaning if we wanted to we could send that solder to space and it would work.

post-par3: With the two day course complete I can being to reflect on what I have learnt. The most important thing when soldering for space is not the actual soldering itself, but the cleaning. You have to clean everything before you start, everything before you solder, everything after you solder and then everything at the end. Small pieces of dirt or flux might not be huge problems down on the ground, but take them into the vacuum of space and suddenly sublimation comes in and ruins your day. I also now know that good alignment and bending can make or break your through hole solders and that surface mounting requires patience, a steady hand and approximately two atoms of solder.

post-par4: Now all that is left to do is polish the CDR presentation and wait for the rest of the team to arrive from Kiruna tomorrow.
