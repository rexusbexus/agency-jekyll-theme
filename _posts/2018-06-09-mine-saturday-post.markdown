post-par1: Work proceeds at pace after the CDR, and now we have been given a pass. Which is great, but now our team have scattered in the wind to all corners in the world. Today we had our meeting with the remaining members in Kiruna. We processed the feedback from the CDR and split them up into tasks like good little worker bees we are. Some of us decided to a teambuilding exercise afterwards, i.e going to the cinema. 

post-par2: On Monday I will start my summer job at the LKAB mine which I look forwards to. Well see how I will handle a full time job and BEXUS during the summer, I think I can manage to juggle two balls at the same. I picked up my ID card the other day and it has the same picture as last years, meaning it's me but clean shaven haha. I really enjoyed working at the mine last year, it wasn't to demanding. One small downside was the shift work. Some weeks you worked day others you worked night, some handle it others don't. One funny thing was that one gets payed extra during the night even if the sun is still up...

post-par3: That covers most things that has happened this week I believe. See y'all next time.
