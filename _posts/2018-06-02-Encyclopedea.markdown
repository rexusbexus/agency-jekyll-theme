post-par1: Hello guys, it’s me again Hamad to entertain you today. So, your very own friend is chilling these days after getting free from the CDR presentation. I know what you are thinking that summer is here, and I deserve some holidays. We are on the same page I guarantee you guys.

post-par2: While visiting ESTEC, two things I like most were the models of the ISS and the Columbus.  If you don’t know about them then you guys need to google or start going to the library. But, I can tell you here for free; ISS stands for International space station and humans, in reality, live over there 24/7 all year around. How cool it is, Yes I know, and Columbus is the science laboratory from the European Space Agency at ISS. Believe me guys, it looks are awesome from the inside. I know you will not forget to thank me so our contact button is at the top right corner; I welcome you in advance. 

post-par3: Have a nice time! Goodbye, Allahafiz, Vi ses.
