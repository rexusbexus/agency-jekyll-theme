post-par1: Flight Compatibility Test has been completed successfully!

post-par2: But what exactly is a Flight Compatibility Test. For the Esrange launch team this is the most important test of the whole camapaign and it is essentially a run through of all the actions that need to take place before flight to check that everything goes as expected and that everyone knows what they're doing. 

post-par3: To begin Hercules, the giant tractor, came along and picked up our gondola. After everything was secured and checked Hercules then drove out to the "sweet spot" on the balloon pad. This is where there is a direct line of sight from the E-link room to the gondola. Here multiple checks are carried out making sure everything is communicating properly. We also run through a practise of the late access. 

post-par4: Once everything is complete Hercules rolls back into the Dome and gives our gondola back to us for the night, as seen in the picture. With a successful pass on this test our gondola is ready to fly ^-^
