post-par1: Hej people! Here a lost member of Science on her way home! Today was a stressful day missing trains, freaking out and of course trying to find hidden plugs in the airport because I cannot forget my BEXUS responsibilities!



post-par2: Can't wait for REAL summer and some darkness! However, BEXUS can never be forgotten... so I might soon find myself working on the beach!



post-par3: Hope all the TUBULAR members are enjoying in Kiruna or their respective places around the world! See you soon!
