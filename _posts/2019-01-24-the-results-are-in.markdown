post-par1: Hej people! It's been a while but we're back with some results. Rejoice! Trace gas concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb). A decreasing concentrationtrend is observed for CO 2, CH4, and CO as the altitude increases. The maximum values are approximately 407 ppm for CO 2, 1.9 ppm for CH 4, and close to 89 ppb for CO. 

post-par2: A sharp decrease of CO2 can be observed in the first layers above the tropopause. Tropopause altitude was at 274 hPa, about 9.8 km. In the stratosphere, values are lower since the exchange between the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere takes several years. Variability is higher near the ground, which agrees with the idea that CO2 may have negative and positive anomalies at the surface that are mainly associated with vegetation uptake and anthropogenic emissions.

post-par3: The mixing ratios of CH4 have a small variability in the troposphere. A strong decrease in the stratosphere is easy to spot with a value of 1.85 ppm near the tropopause and 1.33 ppm at 15.2 km (118 hPa). Variability is higher in the mid-to-upper troposphere and in the stratosphere, which is mostly due to positive anomalies coming from the surface and negative anomalies coming from the stratosphere.

post-par4: It is difficult to draw any conclusions based on measurements extracted from a single sampling flight. Variations of greenhouse gas concentrations would have to be observed through time with data collected over numerous re-flights. Hungry for more? I bet!
