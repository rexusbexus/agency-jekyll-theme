post-par1: Hej people! It's been a while but we're back with some results. Rejoice! In general, the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and CO decrease as the altitude increases. The maximum value of CO2 is 405 ppm, for CH4 is approximately 2 ppm, and for CO it is close to 90 ppb. You'll notice a red asterisk on the x-axis of each plot, it's a reference point for concentrations at 1000 hPa (surface) measured at 20 km from the landing site.

post-par2: A strong decrease of CO2 can be observed in the first layers above 6 km. CO2 reaches its highest value of 405 ppm just above the tropopause (162.5 hPa). In the stratosphere, CO2 values are lower since the exchange rate between upper troposphere and lower stratosphere takes several years. The Mixing ratios of CH4 have a small variability in the troposphere. The strong decrease of CH4 in the stratosphere is easy to spot with a value of 1.9 ppm near the tropopause at 162.5 hPa to that of 1.2 ppm at 20 hPa.

post-par3: CO2 variability is higher near the ground, whereas CH4 variability is higher in the mid-to-upper troposphere and in the stratosphere. This is in agreement with the idea that CO2 may have negative and positive anomalies at the surface (associated mainly with vegetation uptake and anthropogenic emissions), whereas CH4 has mostly positive anomalies coming from the surface and negative anomalies coming from the stratosphere.

post-par4: Hungry for more? I bet! You can read about the results in detail in the SED v5.0 under section Section 7.3.6 - Scientic Results (pp. 163-165). All very exciting!
