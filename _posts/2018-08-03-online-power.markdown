post-par1: First of all, I would like to thank our Krew (Kiruna crew) who is building the experiment during this summer period putting a lot of hours and effort. 
post-par2: From southern Europe while getting fried in the sun (f****** global warming!), we try to help them as much as possible. Lately, after the IPR, the Brain design changed as bit and our human brains were all iterating to get (again) the best possible outcome. Also, the electrical interfaces panel were re-located and a new pressure sensor had to fit inside the saturated Brain. Some manufacturing question arose on how to fix the pneumatic interfaces so they don’t move and mess everything up. To do so, and to facilitate the manufacturing process, we exchange drawings by hand which are complemented by text and video-call discussions.
post-par3: Looking forward to see the experiment late August and be able to still build and fix something! 
post-par4: Cheers!
