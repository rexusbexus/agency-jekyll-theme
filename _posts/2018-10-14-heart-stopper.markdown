post-par1: Today we had our individual experiment testing. Everything started pretty well. We mounted everything into the gondola, no problems. We plugged the power in, no problems. We connected the E-link cable, no problems. Then we begin e-link testing. Enter problems.

post-par2: We would use the walkie talkie to communicate with software, who were up on the balcony, to see if there were any problems. The board would appear to reset or the temperature sensors would stop giving data. Everytime we asked them over the walkie talkie if there were any problems there would seem to be problems. But then we could also go longer stretches of time with no problems. But for sure everytime we used the walkie talkie to ask if there were any problems a problem would suddenly appear. Which is when the penny dropped. The problem occurs every time we talk, every time we turn on the walkie talkie. 

post-par3: In addition to building an air sampling system we have also apparently built a reasonably sized antenna. So when we talk to close to the experiment on the walkie talkie it interferes with our experiment and causes an steep increase of blood pressure in TUBULAR team members.

post-par4: TUBULAR now recommends the use of more old fashioned means of communication such as two tin cans and a piece of string, smoke signals, flag semaphores, carrier pidgeon or just shouting really, really loud.
