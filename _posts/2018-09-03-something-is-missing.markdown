post-par1: Oh geez, what happened here? I'm absent for ONE day and our entire experiment just up and vanishes into thin air! I think the rest of the team might have known something I didn't...

post-par2: Hello again, good readers! The box is gone and so is everyone else - at least for now. We should be six people short right now, due to three having gone to Finland and another three being elsewhere in Europe. The pipe fittings were completed, as were the electronics sections, at least for full-body testing.

post-par3: So with that done, the rest of TUBULAR in Kiruna rests (they REALLY deserve it), while I sit here wondering anxiously what part comes next for us.
