post-par1: Hej people!!!! The Tubular Team has landed in ESTEC today! We feel ready for tomorrows quest, excited to show our work to the panel! 
post-par2: The last two weeks have been a bit stressful, just a tiny little bit, having to take the exams before the rest if the class (thanks to our university to make it possible, they always commit to it giving all the facilities to their students! Tack s√• mycket!). So, two exams, a bunch of projects to submit and, of course the CDR presentation. Just a few adjustments during our flights to the main land and everything is set for tomorrow.
post-par3: Summer has arrived, so after the CDR, university is over until September. Next time you hear from me I will be writing from my beloved Catalonia! Can't wait for that! I leave the Swedish summer to get a REAL summer, time to get some tan and enjoy the family and friends time! Some Bexus work as well making sure our building team staying in Kiruna have all they need to set the mechanical components and pneumatic system ready for the late July revision! Over now, may the force be with us tomorrow! 
post-par4: PS. I don't like to claim for luck, I believe it should only be asked for when life is in danger! Tomorrow is just a challenging step and we gotta give it all! Always commit to what you want!
