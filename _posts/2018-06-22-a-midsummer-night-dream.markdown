post-par1:Today is midsummer eve. The longest day of the year in the northen hemisphere. Also the time of year swedes (and other people) dance around a huge phallus. The church might say that its a cross with the sun and moon and that is a celebration of life. But in truth it's and old pagan fertility ceremony. So yeah, we have small children dancing and singing songs around a huge penis that is meant to secure a rich harvest.

post-par2:The weather of course on midsummer is dreadful, with a high chance of rain and even the occasionall hail. Even if the sun is above the horizon up here forget about seeing it, because you ain't gonna see it.

post-par3:Wise organisers will have planned their dinners indoors or if you want to be outside atleast have a large partyt√§lt that can protect you against against the elements.
