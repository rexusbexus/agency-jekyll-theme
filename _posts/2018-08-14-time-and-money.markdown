post-par1: Long time no see! I know I have been bad with the blogging part recently but hey, better late than never. The last few weeks, it has been quite stressful for our team even when we passed the IPR session. Reason behind this is we are keep placing new orders for extra and necessary components. Some of these orders are in urgent mode, like our order at Bosch Rexroth. It includes the structure bars for the Brain and sliding blocks for attachment to the gondola. Since we haven’t received these bars yet, we are kind of battling against the time because the Brain needs to be build before we can start having fun and building the pneumatic system.

post-par2: Every new order means our budget is getting tighter and tighter which is not a positive thing. But luckily the status right now, it looks we can still afford to buy the spare parts for the electronics which is necessary to have it stocked in the lab. 

post-par3: Anyway this was all from me this time, need to go back and placed the order for the last spares now. Let’s hope the bars will get in our hands very soon !!!
