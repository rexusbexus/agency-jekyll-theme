post-par1: Hej hej! Here is Nuria (late with her blogpost) but with some good news! We recently got confirmation from Rigel Kivi to visit FMI for a second time and do some testing during the first week of September! 



post-par2: But what does this mean for TUBULAR? This will force us to have the experiment almost built for that week, two weeks before the Experiment Acceptance Review so by then, we should be prepared enough to pass. Fingers crossed!



post-par3: I believe in our Kiruna team! They have all been working really hard during the summer to make this happen!
