post-par1: Hi guys, it's Pau! 

post-par2: I'm wrtting again to let you know about an issue I ran into while writting the paper for the 3rd Symposium on Space Educational Activities. I will be attending the event on mid September in Leicester (UK) to present our project including the prupose, the design characteristics, the results obtained and the future plans.

post-par3: However, the reason behind this blogpost is to update you about me doing what I should have to. Do not erase your computer recicle bin they say. Well, as usual, I did, and, accidentally, inside I had part of the text I had been writting for the paper. Keeping calmed is a key for any engineer. This helped me finding the solutions and being able to recover the lost data. 

post-par4: I did so thanks to the FonePaw Data Recovery product. This software allowed me to quickly scan the lost files in my computer and fastly recover them being able to keep working on the paper with no harm at all. It features several options that allow for an easy and safe search. Before starting, the user can select where in the disk and what type of files wants to find. This allows to use the scanning time wisely. In addition, the scanning can be paused and resumed at any time, which allows for checking if the file lost has already been found or to put the search on stand by until a later moment. Undoubtly, I would highly recommend anyone who loses a file to use this software, completly worth it!
