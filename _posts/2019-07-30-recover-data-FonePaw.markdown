post-par1: Hi guys, it's Pau! 

post-par2: I'm wrtting again to let ypu know about an issue I ran into while writting the paper for the 3rd Symposium on Space Educational Activities. I will be attending the event on mid September in Leicester (UK) to present our project including the prupose, the design characteristics, the results obtained and the future plans.

post-par3: However, the reason behind this blogpost is to update you about me doing what I should have to. Do not erase your computer recicle bin they say. Well, as usual, I did, and, accidentally, inside I had part of the text I had been writting for the paper. Keeping calmed is a key for any engineer. This helped me finding the solutions and being able to recover the lost data. 

post-par4: I did so thanks to the FonePaw Data Recovery product. This software allowed me to quickly scan the lost files in my computer and fastly recover them being able to keep working on the paper with no harm at all. Undoubtly, I would highly recommend anyone who loses a file to use this software, completly worth it!
