post-par1: Hi guys, it's Pau from mechanical department! 

post-par2: I'm writting again to let you know about an issue I ran into while working on the paper for the 3rd Symposium on Space Educational Activities. I will be attending the event on mid September in Leicester (UK) to present our project including the prupose, the design characteristics, the results obtained, and the future plans.

post-par3: However, the reason behind this blogpost is to update you about me doing what I shouldn't have had to. Do not erase your computer recicle bin, they say. Well, as usual, I did, and inside I had, accidentally, part of the text I had been writting for the scientific paper. Keeping calmed is key for any engineer. In this case, it helped me find the solution and being able to, fortunately, recover the lost data. I did so thanks to the FonePaw Data Recovery product. 

post-par4: This software allowed me to quickly scan the lost files in my computer and fastly recover them being able to keep working on the paper with no harm at all. It features several options that allow for an easy and safe search. Before starting, the user can select where in the disk and what type of files wants to find. This allows to use the scanning time wisely. I personally focused the search on my entire solid state disk where I have my macOS installed, and set it to find all sort of documents since I was looking for a text (.txt) file. In addition, the scanning can be paused and resumed at any time, which allows for checking if the file lost has already been found or to put the search on stand by until a later moment. In my case, it took less than 10 minutes to find the accidentally erased file, I got lucky to learn about FonePaw right on time. Undoubtly, I would highly recommend anyone who loses a file to use this software, completly worth it! It is an all arrounder offereing countless other options to recover data of all kinds (images, videos, documents, emails, audio, and archives) from external hard disks, memory cards or even crashed computers and corrupted disk partitions.
