post-par1: Hey again, Emil here returning with yet another punishment post! 

post-par2: Time have moved so quickly since my last post so I (agian) totaly forgot to post yesterday. I think I have started a trend of forgeting to post. Or maybe i just like to write blogposts.

post-par3: For me this week has been hectic. I started at my summer work at Essrange and I have had a lot to learing to do and at the same time I'm trying to keep up with all the work that need to be done in TUBULAR. Currently we in the electrical department have been locking down the last few parts that we need to order. I think i mentioned this in my last blogpost, but as always we keep discovering new problems. Although it's better to discover them now rather than later.

post-par4: It's quite stressfull to still find details that might compromise the misson. Although as some smart person once said, you don't learn anything from doing right, you learn from your mistakes. Untill next time, ha de g√∂tt!
