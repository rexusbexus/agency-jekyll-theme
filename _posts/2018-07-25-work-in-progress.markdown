post-par1: Hello guys. It's me Ansyar again. This week we have finished our IPR presentation and hopefully get a pass from BEXUS coordinator.



post-par2: Since, last month our team has been working day to night in order to achive the IPR standard. Honestly, I feel jealous of them, because the building and testing part of the project offer a lot of experience to gain from. There are a lot of problems to solve (which are fun), many team activities, interdiciplinary conversation and more.



post-par3: I can't wait to go back to Kiruna.
