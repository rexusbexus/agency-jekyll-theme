post-par1: Hi guys, it's Georges! Last you heard from us was from Erik as they were prepping to present our experiment at the 24th ESA Symposium on European Rocket and Balloon Programmes and related Research.

post-par2: The entire team was thrilled to get updates from our Swedish delegates Erik, Emil, and Gustav as they attended the symposium and got to meet a whole bunch of interesting peeps. Thank you so much to the organizers but a special thank you to our sponsors the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA) for making it possible for our Swedes to attend.

post-par3: The reflight with FMI is still in the back burner but someone at the Symposium also suggested that maybe we could also be able to fly on the HEMERA H2020, will we apply?!

post-par2: HEMERA is "a Research Infrastructure funded by the Horizon 2020 framework Programme of the European Union which integrates a large starting community in the field of tropospheric and stratospheric balloon-borne research, to make existing balloon facilities available to all scientific teams in the European Union, Canada and associated countries."
