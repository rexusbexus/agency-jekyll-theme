post-par1: Hej people, Georges here and I'm here to talk to you about real life experience!

post-par2: This summer I'm working at the European Space Agency (ESA) in Frascati, near Rome, as part of their traineeship programme at the Future Systems Department for the Copernicus Programme. It's super cool!

post-par3: My day to day work revolves around a satellite mission that will be launched in Q2 2019. It just recently passed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). What is that you say, PDR? Doesn't this sound familiar? Yes! It's exactly the same process we go through in the REXUS/BEXUS programme! You guys, this is why REXUS/BEXUS is awesome. It really reflects the actually work environment at an organization like ESA. So Cool! As soon as I started working here I was already familiar with all the lingo and process thanks to REXUS/BEXUS. Hoorah!

post-par4: So, what I'm trying to say here is that as students of space industry related fields we should really get invovled in as many projects as we can to get familiar with the realy life work environment, it's worth it! I'm eternally grateful to the REXUS/BEXUS programme for the experience it has provided me with. You can also do it!
