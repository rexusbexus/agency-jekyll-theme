post-par1: The pump rides high on the bexus balloon, Not a sputter to be seen, The bags we know are empty, When the airflow doesn’t move. The PCB it just resets over again, It looks like this is it, our box is dead.

post-par2: Don’t give up hope, Don’t quit it now, Maybe we can save something somehow, The CAC it can still work, So don’t let that valve close

post-par3: Let it go, let it go, Don’t love the pump anymore, Let it go, let it go, The CAC can show us more

post-par4: The air don’t care if its bags or tubes, Let the samples come, The pump never bothered me anyway
