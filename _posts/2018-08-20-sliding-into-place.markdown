post-par1: Feels good to be back! I hope that sliding back into the flow of work in Kiruna will feel as satisfying is it feels seeing the brain cover fit around the frame.

post-par2: Welcome back, good readers! Having returned to Kiruna, I can present a picture of my own to the growing gallery showing the physical experiment being developed. This part was made by Emil and Erik, so props to them. The boundaries that separated each division's work have now dissolved, leaving us to witness for example, the development of a mechanical structure from the combined effort of members of the electrical and thermal teams!

post-par3: It seems that Ansyar and I (who returned on the same day) arrived just in time to be present for the next meeting with our mentor. That will be happening in the hour. Things are on track - we have 13 days until some of the group will need to travel to FMI to perform an experiment flushing to see that the hardware responds appropriately. All that remains now is to make sure we all know how what to do.
