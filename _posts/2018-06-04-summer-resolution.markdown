post-par1: Hello again, good readers! Looks like the summer period is upon us! So many have said their warm goodbyes. But as has been discussed ever since Winter Break ended, this summer will be anything but a vacation from BEXUS. You can outrun it about as well as you can bury your own shadow beneath the sand on a sunny beach (trust me, my five-year-old-self is still terrified by that to this day)!

post-par2: So if you are wondering, yesterday was supposed to be when I next uploaded! But surprise, surprise - I forgot! I must have been really beat from moving to another place of residence in Kiruna just last Saturday! Well, there is no place for excuses in the hierarchy of success once one starts climbing it, so I will own up to this: By making two blog posts in one day! That’s right - you get to see twice the amount of writing content from me! But because this is me, don’t expect twice the quality to go with it. It’s 23:05 as I write this exact sentence, and I had a lot of stuff to do today. The sign says to have a good summer, but until I have repaid my debts and cut corners for BEXUS, it’s just me having “a summer”. Oh, and I believe my history of studying the French language is goading me into suspecting that the French expression needs to be written in the imperative form to make sense. Funny enough, I was wrong - it’s actually “passe un bon ete,” with the accents missing from the e’s in “ete,” because the coding behind this blog accepts only directly English characters. It is about as international as Pernik, Bulgaria - a town like Kiruna, stemming from a mining business that has since caused a slow, ongoing collapse of its own (economically speaking).

post-par3: Speaking of which, I miss Pernik, maybe just a bit. It is where I used to spend my summers when I was a kid. But the sunny mountains and forests of my country of origin are just that - my origin. BEXUS holds the contract for my future right now - so I’d best help out my team in securing a triumphant accomplishment, so we can conclude this program and apply to do our theses in places a bit.warmer than here.
