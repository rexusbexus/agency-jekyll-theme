post-par1: 9 days remain until we get our visit from REXUS/BEXUS for our Experiment Acceptance Review (EAR) to tell us if we its a fly or no fly result. 

post-par2: Thanks to our forward planning and everyone sticking to our internal deadlines we now only have a couple of things left to do. Gluing some of our sensors down into permanent positions now all testing is wrapped up, cleaning out our pneuamtic system one last time before we fully seal it and last but not least getting the final weight of our boxes.

post-par3: We still aim to be done with all these tasks by the end of this week giving us a little breathing room and some time to clean up the lab ^^'

post-par4: For now its back to the final preparations and dreaming of the launch campaign.
