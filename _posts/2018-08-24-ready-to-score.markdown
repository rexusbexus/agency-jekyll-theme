post-par1: Hello Teresa and rest of the world! Science team member Kiki is baaaaaack in Kiruna! Time for some BEXUS action! Yesterday i got to meet our baby in person! It was super exciting and love from the first sight!  

post-par2: I put some gloves on (otherwise Jordi bites and you let Natalie down) and helped with the cleaning and the cutting of some tubes. Next task is to cut the tubes that connect the bags with the manifold. But first we have to find out the size of each tube which will be different for each bag since not all of them will have the same distance from the manifold.  

post-par3: Cut, bend if necessary, clean and connect. Repeat for all bags. 

post-par4: Have you noticed the look of the polar bear sticker on Natalie's laptop? I think it approves :D
