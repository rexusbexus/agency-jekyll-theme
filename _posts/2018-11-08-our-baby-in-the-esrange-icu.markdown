post-par1: The last time you saw us we had just recieved our AAC baby back from the flight and discovered that it had unfortunately failed to sample anything, but we didn't yet know why. So the very first thing the next morning, 19th October, our poor little baby got sent to the Esrange ICU for failure analysis.

post-par2: As we didn't know what went wrong the with AAC we had to follow very strict procedures to ensure that we did not destroy the evidence! We assigned Kiki to note taker, myself to photographer, Emil to electronics diagnoser and Pau to mechanics diagnoser and got to work. 

post-par3: Taking off one wall at a time we completed a throuough visual inspection of all parts of the experiment and found everything to be as it should. Once this was complete we moved on to connection testing, looking for shorts or bad connections. Again no problems were detected.

post-par4: Finally we tried turning everything back on. To our surprise everything worked. Including the pump. We managed to trace the problem back to a current limitation on the pump which was then dropping the voltage causing the Arduino to reset. But still we didn't know the exact cause of this. Now we've taken a little time for respite we're back to our post flight analysis and we've begun investigating why we're seeing this problem on the pump in the hopes that we can solve it and fly our system again!
