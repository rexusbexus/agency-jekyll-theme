post-par1: Erik from thermal back again with new figures. One of the hardest requirements were to keep the pump above 5 degrees for the whole flight. How to check that you ask without trying.

post-par2: Simulations in ANSYS and MATLAB, as seen in my image is two lines of data taken from the ANSYS simulations that have been done. In between the vertical dotted lines it is above 15km. Have chosen that because we start sample soon after and at 15km it is almost 15 percent of air density left. So assumptions of no air inside can be made.

post-par3: With how it is built now it should be able to run and sample at low altitude (Air in the Brain line) and at high altitude (No air in the Brain line). Now it is just to test during summer to verify it works!
