post-par1: Hi everyone! Last week some of the members of TUBULAR were in ESTEC for our CDR which means that we all work crazily during the previous weeks. Now after the CDR storm we are all in a chilling period waiting for all the material that has been ordered to start building. The excitement of the team when we receive something is always priceless... Just yesterday we received our cool patches and I hope by the end of the week we get the hoodies as well.  



post-par2: But... What to do meanwhile? How to keep you entertained? I just found in between my pictures from the FMI trip something I would like to share with you. Do you see that weird thing hanging on the wall? It is the AirCore sampler! The AirCore sampler consists of a tube divided in fifteen stages. 



post-par3: As you might know, the AirCore samples air and it has to be analysed as soon as possible in order to minimise the loss of resolution. The more we wait to analyse, the more the gas mixes. The AirCore sampler is connected to the end of the Picarro analyser, so after the analysis, the sample is not wasted, it is kept in this sampler. Once the sample has been introduced, the fifteen valves close separating the sample in fifteen different levels and avoiding further mixing which makes possible future analysis (less precise though).
