post-par1: Hi, Emil here again writing to you from the project lab at LTU.

post-par2: Here in the lab, we are hard at work. Every day some progress is being made. And as you can see from the picture our CAC box is almost ready to fly. It just needs some final touches and all the intrenal components.

post-par3: By every day that passes by we are getting closer to our deadline. The FMI trip. And by every day that passes the stress is growing larger. Luckily for us we have suport coming to Kiruna soon to help out in the building progress. And hopfully everything will be alright. 

post-par4: Thats todays post, it will have to be a short and easy one since i have to get back to work. Untill next time, Ha de g√∂tt!
