post-par1: Hej people! Project Manager Georges here with his last post as a Project Manager! That's right, now that the Critical Design has been submitted it is time for more capable leadership to take this baby into the next level and actually build it. Plus, I suspect the team is getting a bit weary of me assigning them tasks like hot potatoes fresh out of the oven. Change is good! Who is the new PM, you ask? Drumroll... Natalie Lawton!

post-par2: This leadership change has been planned for quite some time actually. More precisely, since I found out that I wasn't going to be able to be physically present at our Space Campus home base in Kiruna during the very exciting Experiment Building and Testing phase of the project. I leave at the end of this month and won't be back to Space Campus until early October, just a few weeks prior our launch window. There are several ways I can still contribute remotely, notably with documentation, outreach, assisting our new fearless leader, and hopefully I can team up with Ansyar and Gustav with software development efforts.

post-par3: In my opinion, the best Project Managers are the ones who continuously aims to make themselves redundant. I definitely got a lot of help from Natalie in this aspect where she's basically been acting as a Deputy Project Manager for quite some time now. Because of this, the transition is happening quite smoothly and I'm sure the team will do a fantastic job supporting her leadership. Got Natalie! Go Team!

post-par4: Peace out.
