post-par1: Long time no see, good readers! This is the second of my Double-Blog-Post-Featurette! So, with the introductory post out of the way, let me speak a bit more on what has happened. First the important BEXUS-related news - it seems, that my comrades that travelled over to the Netherlands succeeded in making one heck of a good presentation! More updates to hopefully come from that in more future blog posts. We’re on the right track now!

post-par2: Now, if you saw my last post just a few minutes ago, you may know that it is now summer season, and everyone is gone. Like everyone (I wish this blog had italics). I only saw three Swedes, Guillermo (fellow BEXUS member from our predecessor IRIS), and Emily. At least, that meant one other member could still be here. See, last Friday, many of us walked into the school building with a horrible sense of trepidation as we prepared to slay the “final boss” of this year: the Space Communication Exam. It wasn’t the easiest course we had taken and to be honest, I am only marginally convinced I passed mine. But once the required questions were answered, a wave of euphoria inundated me, as well as apparently many others. We walked out feeling like champion warriors of a sort (or at least I might have for five seconds). But that’s just the thing - if you think video-game logic for a moment, what earthly purpose would you have sticking around in the boss’s lair after it’s been defeated? If it doesn’t self-destruct, you’re just kind of left there with only your own thoughts to contemplate what you have just done. The others are gone - they left and you still haven’t. Such is how I feel right now. I am still here and I don’t really know what to do for the short while longer that I am here before I depart for my summer holidays.

post-par3: Needless to say, PM Natalie to the rescue! She is still here, and so is around half of our team! I must have assumed everyone left, but in fact, I just happened to be one of the very few who went to school today. There will be work in the coming days, and also good company with whom to share it! Maybe, lingering here a bit longer wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
