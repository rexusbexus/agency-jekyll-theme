post-par1: After the craziness of the CDR and the scramble that followed to make sure we were still on track we finally completed one of our key goals, ordering the bulk of the parts. With so many last minute changes coming in it was not an easy task to get the mechanical, thermal and electrical order lists sorted. Even now we still have a few outstanding items, but at least for these ones we have a game plan now.

post-par2: We of course have to keep giving shout outs to all our amazing component sponsors, SMC, Swagelok, Restek, Silcotek, Teknolab, without their expert knowledge, advice and enthusiasm to help us realise our project we would be in a sticky situation right now >.<

post-par3: So for now the waiting game begins. With a relatively quiet period upon us we're working hard to make sure our SED is up to date with all the feedback we got from CDR and making sure any last design niggles are sorted out. We've also been booking in our first tests to make sure we get the dates secured.

post-par4: We know as soon as the first parts start rolling in the door life's going to go crazy again, so we want to make sure we're ready for it. And until then I'll be in my bed catching up on some much needed sleep ^^'
