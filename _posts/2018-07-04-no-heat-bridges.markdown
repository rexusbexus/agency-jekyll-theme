post-par1: One of the biggest issues that came with the CDR’s feedback was the conductive heat paths from the gondola to our experiment. Since the required operational temperature of the electronics and pneumatic components is much higher than the outside temperature at 25km of altitude, a proper insulation is a must to minimize failure risks.

post-par2: Therefore, the direct contact between the gondola and the aluminum structure of the boxes was working as a huge heat sink that decreased our thermal control system efficiency below ground.

post-par3: To avoid this, a bunch of rubber bumpers will defend our experiment from the artic cold environment like Gandalf against the Balrog in Moria. To not keep our experiment “floating” attached to this new interface bumpers, Styrofoam bars will be screwed to the rails of the structure in-between the gondola and the bottom of the boxes, providing insulation and a base support to reduce the stress in the fixations.
