post-par1: With 3 weeks until our Experiment Acceptance Review (EAR) and 3 weeks and 2 days until the start of the launch campaign it's all systems go in the team right now. We're now on the final tests and tweaks, making sure everything is running perfectly. We're aiming to be finished a week earlier than this and we're confident we will make this internal deadline.

post-par2: It wouldn't be a true student experiment if we weren't still having some lingering problems. Vacuum testing has finally completed two days late after days full of recoding the software, discovering one power source was current limiting us, losing the adapter for the MicroSD card and finally breaking our power adapter forcing us to undergo some rapid resoldering. However we persevered and now we can finally say vacuum testing is passed!

post-par3: Next up comes the mechanical tweaks and testing. Prior to testing in Finland we felt we needed to re-do some of the tubing and the Finland trip only confirmed this. Once the tubing is re-done we will move onto our static load and impact testing. The trick here is to test the experiment well without breaking anything, but team confidence is high we can achieve this.

post-par4: As I write this we are also doing the first of our long duration tests. Early this morning we plugged the PCB into the temperature sensors and will leave it running all day. The purpose is troubleshooting after we noticed some problems during thermal testing. Hopefully today's test will shed some light on the problem and confirm if it is a software or electrical issue.
