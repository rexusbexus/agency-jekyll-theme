post-par1: Hej people, Georges here eagerly refreshing the parcel tracking page for our awesome inert Sulfinert treated stainless steel tubing sponsored and sent to us by the folks over at SiloTek!

post-par2: We've already accepted that we won't receive it early enough that we could do anything with it for our fast approaching Integration Progress Review (IPR) but... maybe? Most likely not... but maybe? 

post-par3: As you can see from the parcel tracking page screenshot, there seems to be progress made as it has shipped from "Malmö, Sweden" to just "Sweden." 

post-par4: It's the little parcel that could. I believe in you!
