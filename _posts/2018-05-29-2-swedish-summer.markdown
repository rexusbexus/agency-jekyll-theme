post-par1: I will be talking about the Swedish summer and what to look forward to and what you readers might want to test celebrate (If you are not doing it already). Now that we are in Kiruna there is some errors in nature during summer. We have had our last night for a while so yeah sun at every moment during the day, who needs to sleep anyway. It makes it a lot easier to just forget how late it is and then to go sleep (more time to build BEXUS).

post-par2: Then a guide for dressing accordingly to the Swedish summer. The definition of a perfect summer might be a lot of sun, 30 degrees in the shade and laying at the beach. A dream is good but the summer is more about a mindset here, above 10 degrees it is shorts weather if it gets to 20 in the sun it is a good day. Even if there is a lot of clouds you just look for a spot of blue sky focus on it imagining summer.

post-par3: Now that you know how to dress I will go into the famous midsummer day that will come in about a month. It is the day when people gather celebrate the longest of days with lots of food, drinks and dance. The main part of it is the food. A traditionally lunch should be potatoes and herring, going with it there is the “nubbe” (snaps). When you want to drink your “nubbe” you have to sing a song and every family present should contribute with at least one song.

post-par4: Then comes the dancing, it will be a circle dance around a maypole, singing songs dancing around. For those interested and want to practice some of the songs are. Karusellen, Morsgrisar är vi allihopa, Prästens lilla kråka, Sju vackra flickor i en ring, Raketen and a lot more. Now you know more about the Swedish summer, it’s traditions on how to celebrate.
