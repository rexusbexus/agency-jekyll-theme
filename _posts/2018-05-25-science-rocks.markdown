post-par1: Tjena kexen! How are you? I am Kiki and i am good! Summer is here, the grass is green again and the sun is shinning! Do you need more reasons to be happy? But oh wait! There is something or to be more precise someone, that disturbs my peace..
post-par2: Can you make a guess? I'll give you a clue. It's the other science team member! And you know why? Because she gets to write her blog before me and so, she always keeps you updated about our team's work, and I have nothing to say!  
post-par3: Well well, I'll give you a general team update. Today we are having our mock presentation before the CDR. In 15 minutes! I am not presenting, but we all going to be there, support and give our feedback to the ones who presenting so they can nail their presentation next week :) After that, we are having a team meeting, probably the last one with everyone in one place before summer, to plan how we will proceed the next days.      
post-par4: I have to leave you now (don't cry). Wish us luck! See you soon xxx
