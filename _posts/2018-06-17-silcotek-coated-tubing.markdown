post-par1: Hej people, looks like we have a new sponsor on board... Many thanks to the folks over at SilcoTek!

post-par2: SilcoTek are THE guys to go to for corrosion resistance and chemical inertness coating that performs in the most challenging material applications. They will provide us with the tubes we need for the air sampling system that will connect our pump to our sampling bags. 

post-par3: If the air samples we collect chemically react with our experiment's material then our samples are pretty much worthless. What a catastrophe that would be! This means that inertness is a big deal and Sulfinert coating from SilcoTek will make sure our samples remain pure.

post-par4: What we're getting exactly is 50ft of Welded/Drawn 304 Grade Stainless Steel Tubing (Sulfinert Treated). This coated tubing is fantastic for inert applications. Sulfinert is a required treatment for metal components when analyzing for parts-per-billion levels of organo-sulfur compounds. Wow!
