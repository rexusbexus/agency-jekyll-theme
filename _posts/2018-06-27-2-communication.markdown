post-par1: Hi all! Emil back to doing double blogposts again! As you might have figured from the plural in the last post.

post-par2: Communication is always a huge part in all projects. Even if you only are two persons doing the project. For us in TUBULAR, the communication have gotten somewhat of a problem. Atleast in my opinion.

post-par3: Curently we are communication through chat. Which worked fine when everyone was in Kiruna and you could talk to everyone. But now when a large portion of the team is abroad and some of us in Kiruna are working there is typicaly 100 messages to read after work. These are ofcourse all out of order and there is 10 different sunjects being discussed at once. For now this have not led to any major problems. But i fear that some critical information might get lost.

post-par4: I personaly don't have a quick and easy fix to this. But we should probably make some kind of communications plan and move over some parts to email or some other service in which one can devide the topics that are used. There are several solutions to this problem. The question is just what is easiest to move over to since i supsect that most people are quite used to way things work now. I might update you in the future on what we did about this, but until then, Ha de g√∂tt!
