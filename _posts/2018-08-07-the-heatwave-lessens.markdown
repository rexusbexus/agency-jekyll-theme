post-par1: Hello again, good readers! Well, we are now in August - the month where everyone will be coming back to join with the Krew as we prepare for the harrowing September. When that month arrives, I believe I will be one of the first to comment on our progress (assuming no schedule changes).

post-par2: You may have noticed, if not outright experienced the massive heatwave rolling across all of Europe during the last couple of weeks. If memory serves, I recall North America also getting hit by it. Now considering this is the same year which had the terrifying blizzard sweep across North America and make its presence felt partially in Europe (thankfully not so much in Kiruna), we are definitely feeling the effects of climate change. It’s like we are on the run from some monster, but time is on its side since it’s closing the gap of a head start we have on it from before our industrial revolution. In a sense, we need all the information we can get on exactly what is contributing to this - which includes knowing the proportion of trace gases in our atmosphere and in turn, their concentrations at given altitudes. We are of course, just one group of university students, with only two in our scientific division - but we can still leave a mark by providing in our final SED version a report on our findings in the atmosphere. If our experiment works, the results can bring awareness to the less frequently visited portions of our atmosphere and contribute to existing data on trace gases.

post-par3: Of course, the scientific aim of our experiment has to contend with the technological side of it because our suitcase-sized box is first a proof of concept, and THEN a tool for atmospheric research. Priority goes to the technology because if it doesn’t work, we get no science anyway. Suddenly, I am very much hoping the Krew is making great advances, because many of us outside the Krew are still not due to return for a couple of weeks!
