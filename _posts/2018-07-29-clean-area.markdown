post-par1: Hej people! It's Kiki again and since some people implied that we are dirty, let's continue talking about cleaning! Last time I talked about the cleaning of the CAC and AAC systems. But what happens with the outside? We have booked a corner (seen in the picture) in the lab that we keep clean and it is where we build the experiment! Looks like that cleanliness is high priority when you manufacture! 

post-par2: How are we gonna do that? Well, the workplace and the tools will be cleaned thoroughly with IPA or aceton before use, while all the team members involved, shall wear powderfree gloves! Standard cleanroom wipes will be used and pressured air, if allowed in the lab. 

post-par3: Every component of the experiment must be wipped off at its ends and parts before assembly. After the completion of the building, flushing the system with IPA/aseton will be necessary. Doing so, any unwanted particles like dust will be removed and any residual grease or oil will be resolved.    

post-par4: Keep the working area free from other people!! (Photo credits to Erik)
