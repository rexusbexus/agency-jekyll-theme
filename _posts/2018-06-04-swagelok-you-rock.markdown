post-par1: Hej people! I'd like you to meet Part No. SS-400-3 - Stainless Steel Swagelok Tube Fitting, Union Tee. It's one of the many components that are donated to us by Swagelok, one of our super duper amazing sponsors without which we wouldn't be able to build and launch our experiment.

post-par2: One of the most exciting aspect of the REXUS/BEXUS programme is the opportunity to build partnerships with the private sector, notably with component manufacturers and suppliers. This is a fantastic glimpse on space industry collaborations between different contractors, all working together towards building a successful mission that meets all of the requirements. Companies that we've reached out to for sponsorship and support always get excited about our project and really go above and beyond to help us pull through by providing both their expertise and products. The folks over at Swagelok are providing tremendous support and genuily want us to be succeed. You guys, so many people are excited about our project, it's a great motivation to ensure a successful mission because we don't want to let our supporters down.

post-par3: Swagelok designs, manufactures, and delivers an expanding range of fluid system products and solutions. They produce high quality stuff, their fittings and tubing interfaces will ensure that the air we sample reliably travels from our pump to our sampling bags for a successful end-to-end sampling flow!

post-par4: Cheers to you, Swagelok, thank you for your support. We won't let you down!
