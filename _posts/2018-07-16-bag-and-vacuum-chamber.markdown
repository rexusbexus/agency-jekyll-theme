post-par1: Hello people! Long time no see! It's the science team member Kiki and today I am going to introduce you to our very first test. But first I have to admit that I am sad that I miss all the fun, building the experiment with my teammates! Back to the point now. 

post-par2: In the picture, you see a sampling bag posing inside a vacuum chamber.  Its actual goal was to test the pump's performance at low pressures but we also took the chance to see how our beautiful bags behave. Some bags were fully filled and some others were half empty while one bag was not so lucky. It was filled with air continuously until it was burst! RIP our lovely bag! Your contribution to our test was precious! The team honored the bag with several pictures of it,  in the SED document (Test 30, Appendix O)!  You will be remembered forever!  

post-par3: This test was a success and gave the team many instructive lessons !! The pump works perfectly under a low-pressure environment. The test made clear how important is the careful emptying of the bags, since even a little amount of air that is left inside, is enough to half-fill the bag before even start the sampling! What is more, the half-filled bags in a low-pressure environment, when the vacuum chamber was opened, were almost empty! So, it is crucial to sample the right amount of air in order to assure that we have enough sample left for analysis!  

post-par4: That's all for now! xxx <3
