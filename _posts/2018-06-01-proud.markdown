post-par1: Hai hai.. Ansyar is here!! Yesterday was a big day for us. We just finished the CDR and hopefully we will pass it as well. There is nothing more that I can say to express my feeling than PROUD. I'm so proud of the team, we worked hard, but also study hard. (Yeehaa). FYI, we have just finished our last exam today (wohooo).

post-par2: On top of that, I am so grateful for the positive feedback that we got in CDR, especially for Software Team. The first feedback we had was "above expectations". Yes, the time that we spent coding and debugging was not wasted at all. From the start we already aimed to finish the software prototype before summer, so that the others can do testing (e.g. sampling testing) to their heart content. So what do we have so far? There are several crucial parts in this experiment, i.e. sampling and communicataion (to ground station).

post-par3: First sampling, I remember I developed the algorithm for the first time, simple but not tested yet. However, because of the rapid changes and increasing demands, the algorithm had some flaws. Then, I gathered all demands from other teams, science requirements and electrical limitations, then, in 10 minutes, I developed a completely different algorithm. Finally last Saturday I and Gustav tested the OBC and GS communication link, and it works. After that established, we can test my 10 minutes algorithm, aaaannndddd..... It worked  (again so proud). Eventhough there were 2 bugs, first one was a really stupid mistake by me (I misplaced 1 syntax in different functions). The software crashed after reaching that syntax. The next bug was also basic mistake. At that one place for no reason, I started counting  arrays in C++ from 1 (It has to start from 0). After fixing the bugs, now we have a working prototype that can handle sampling and several important electrical limitations and don't forget, it can be commanded manually as well. Oh I forgot to mentioned, we succesfully created a simple simulation environment for the software. With this, we know how the software behave with "real" conditions. 

post-par4: In anyway, I learned a lot from this project and still hoping for more experience to come. See you on the next post. SOFTWARE ROCKS!!!
