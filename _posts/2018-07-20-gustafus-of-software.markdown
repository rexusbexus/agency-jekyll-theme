post-par1: Hejsan. Today it is I Gustafus Dryssenson of the land of söftware speaking to you. It have been ä very busy week.
post-par2: Every morning I wake up before the sunrises, which is quite the task when one lives in the time of the midnight sun, and go down to the mine. Once åll the things that need to be mined that shift have been mined I still cannot rest for BEXUS never sleeps.
post-par3: I go immediately from work to the university where I find my most åmazing, wonderful, smart, clever and funny team members and we get to wårk. The länd of söftware is not always a happy place, sometimes evil things called bugs appear and sometimes when öne defeats one bug three more appear in its place.
post-par4: However as long as one does not give up the evil bugs can be slain and söftware land returned to peace. Now I must go back to my duties expanding the land of söftware by conquering the lands of pump, sensorer and heäters and helping the land of söftware to know how to deal with the natural disasters of SD card loss, cömmunication loss and re-sets.
