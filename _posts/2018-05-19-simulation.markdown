post-par1: Haloha... It's me again, Ansyar, one of the creators of Tubular's soul. Why soul? Because the electronics box is called The Brain. Then, the software becomes the soul of The Brain.

post-par2: As part of developing the soul, the software team is trying to create the flight environtment of Bexus or in general people call it simulation. The simulation feature is supposed to feed the software all environment variables, such as presssure, temperature, airflow, and humidity. Using this, the "bad" behaviour, i.e. bug, errors, of the software could be catched early. Then, we can feel more confident of the software. 
post-par3: So, the idea is the variables will be feed from the SD card. The card will contain several files that creates the simulation environment. For example, the pressure data is in the pressSim.txt file, which also contain the timeline of the feed. Say that the simulation will run for 1 hour, the feeding schedule could be set based on the user preference. It could be with interval of 20 minutes, or more. 
post-par4: Hopefully, we, software team, can establish this simulation ASAP, so we can test the software based on "real" data environment. See you guys next time. Cheerss~~
