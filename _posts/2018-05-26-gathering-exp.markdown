post-par1: It’s been already 12 days from the SEDv2.0 due and I’ve start to notice some side effects every time I look myself into the mirror. My friends say that I still have a ride, but I don’t know what to say. Indeed, I know; hello people, I am Jordi and I am 25 and BEXUS.

post-par2: BEXUS as a measure of time? It is widely known that a human year is equivalent to seven dog years, so the question is, how many years are equivalent to one BEXUS project? It’s not stated anywhere. May I develop a Matlab scrip to calculate that?

post-par3: Am I still in the age to have kids? Who knows? Can I retire without even finish my University studies? Ahhh such a dream would never occur, but anyway, that’s so confusing dude. To be honest, I was expecting that this programme would help you to grow, but I would never imagine in that way.

post-par4: But hey! That’s not the point, if only that was true, would that mean we travelled in time? Am I older than my parents? Crazy, that trip should be announced in the manual! Whatever… looking at the bright side, at least I could avoid madness.
