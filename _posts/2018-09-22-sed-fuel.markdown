post-par1: Team TUBULAR has made their home in Kiruna's learning centre once more. This can only mean one thing, it's SED writing party time once again.

post-par2: We're now up to the 4th version of our SED which updates on the third version with the results from testing and if any changes have occured during manufacture.

post-par3: In order to keep the TUBULAR engine runnning it's important to keep the fuel tanks full and today we got an express delivery that did just that.
