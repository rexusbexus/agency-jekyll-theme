post-par1: Now I am back and today were election day in Sweden will be interesting to see how this works out. 
 
post-par2: But back to the more fun part, this last week they have been doing some thermal testing in Finland at FMI and I have been eagerly waiting to see how it have been going and if the calculations and simulations have been correct.
 
post-par3: Even if I were not with them enjoying a lot of hour close to a freezer I have been working on some more accurate PCB thermal simulations to see more closely how the PCB should behave. Also acting as thermal support if they had any questions. For now it is just sit and evaluate their results and see what we can do as improvements.
