post-par1: Hej gott folk! Today it all ends. Well... not all. But the last day of this semester has finally arrived! All exams have been written and campus Kiruna is mostly emptied of students!
post-par2: As you might have noticed someone forgot to write a blogpost yesterday due to his or hers intense last-minute studying for today’s exam. This someone might have been me(Emil). And as you may know, forgetting to blog gives us the opportunity to write you guys an extra blogpost! HURAY!
post-par3: Yesterday was the big go or no-go day for Tubular. The CDR presentation. I did not attend since I joined the team so recently and I must say, I'm yellows of everyone that went to the Netherlands to present. From what I understood over the high-tech communication channels we use (totally not strings and cans) the presentation went well and hopefully the answer for the Tubular team regarding when to start building is two weeks ago! Although we still await confirmation.
post-par4: Now that the exams are done and the CDR is done we can finally enjoy the summer that all the recent blogposts have talked about. I'm sure I will enjoy at least looking out at the summer through the window of the workshop this summer. Until next time, ha de gött!
