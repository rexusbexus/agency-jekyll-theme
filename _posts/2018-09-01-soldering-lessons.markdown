post-par1: Hello peeps! Hola Cristina! El teu germ√† et troba a faltar! The team is working on the last details to get the experiment build and ready for testing! And we are doing really well!   

post-par2: But today was not just a typical day! Today i got to solder a temperature sensor!! Emil, who i have to congratulate for his patience skills (super important skill if you ask an impatient person like me) was my teacher. After watching him soldering, i got tempted and wanted to try myself. And for a first timer, anyone would agree that i did well! Until i broke a sensor's leg. One out of its eight legs. Who cares, right? No no no (as Emil would say). It was an important one. Thank god we have spares! It's a student's experiment afterall. RIP temp sensor. You did well! I was clumpsy.    

post-par3: So, after my unsuccessful attempt to solder, i went back to my department and did some science! Now that the tubes, which will connect the bags with the manifold, are cut and their lengths are known, it was time to calculate the air that will remain inside them. Some MatLab and graphs later, the results were taken and comparing them with our best and worse case scenarios, the deviation was small! Good thing right? The only thing remaining, is to see how and if this left air, affects our samples.     

post-par4: At this point, to avoid any misunderstanding, Emil was a great teacher! If anytime in the future I decide to solder again, its Emil who i will refer to! Lucky Emil!
