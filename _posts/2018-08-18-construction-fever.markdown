post-par1: We now have 15 days remaining until we have to take the experiment to Finland for testing. By this point we need to be essentially built in order to complete these tests properly. What this means for now is we have a lot of contstruction to get done in not very much time.

post-par2: Luckily a lot of the experiment is starting to take good shape now with the PCB soldered, most of the structure completed and the software getting closer to completion each day.

post-par3: But we don't have any time to be resting. The pneumatic system is going to take time to complete and we need to be very careful with its construction to ensure it stays as clean as possible. We will also have to ensure we are cutting and bending the tubing with high precision to ensure we get a leak free system.

post-par4: All in all its going to be a crazy 2 weeks ahead, but we've had crazy weeks before so I'm sure we'll make it ^-^
