post-par1:Whatsssss up TUBULAR readers, and yes your mech girl Emily is back again! As you maybe already know, the team is already preparing for the CDR presentation. At the same time the unwelcomed exams are also getting closer. Bleeeeeh, but luckily we have some good news to cheers  us up a bit. Many of you maybe already know, I have been in crazy contact with a lot of vendors such as Parker, Bosch Rexboth and Swagelok for the past weeks. I kind of become the sponsor hunter in this team and the good news this week is... *drums*  Swagelok are very interested for a sponsorship with TUBULAR team. Since most of the mechanical components in our experiment are based on theirs products, this will be a tremendous support! This is not officially decided but I still want to thank Swagelok for giving us this opportunity. 

post-par2:Anyway, I feel the assignments and exams are hunting me right now and therefor I need to leave you guys with such a short blogpost. But I can promise, next time it will be longer and hopefully I will be able to share more good news! For now, take care and see you soon!
