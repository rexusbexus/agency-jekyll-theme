post-par1: Around 10 days ago we got a very exciting shipment of 150 TUBULAR patches. It's kind of weird and also pretty cool to see your own logo in 3D format and understandably everyone and their mum wanted one which leads us to where we are now with an amazing 91 out of 150 patches already gone in only 10 days!

post-par2: Those of you who are quick with maths will know that leaves us ith only 59 patches remaining. Only 59 more lucky people who get to hold a piece of TUBULAR and REXUS/BEXUS history forever. Will one of those 59 be you?

post-par3: It's also fun to consider where all these patches will end up in the world. With such an international teams one thing we can be sure of is that the name TUBULAR will be known worldwide with patches heading for places as far as Pakistan and Indonesia. Though according to Google the furthest place away from Kiruna is Terra Nova Bay in Antartica where the Italian Mario Zucchelli Station is located, with our old project manager Georges currently working in Italy maybe he can find a way to get a TUBULAR patch to the furthest point away from home.

post-par4: But with all this good news about the patches finally arriving there's still one question on every team members lips. Where are the hoodies? The answer to that is hopefully within the next few days! So stay tuned to check out our new wardrobe when it finally arrives.
