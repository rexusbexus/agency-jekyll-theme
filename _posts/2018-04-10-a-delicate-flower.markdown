post-par1: Hej hej, good afternoon from the electronics team. Today lets introduce you to what is perhaps our most critical component, the lungs of TUBULAR. With the smallest operating temperature range of all of our components and the greediest power consumption it is a demanding and delicate component to work with.

post-par2: Formally known as NMP 850.1.2 KNDC B and more affectionately known as The Pump this crucial component is responsible for drawing in air from outside the experiment and pumping it into our sampling bags. So, no pump no samples. But this is an avoidable fate.

post-par3: In order to make sure that the pump operates as expected it will undergo extensive testing. We want to be absolutely certain about how it will perform. Tests will include low pressure, low temperature, power consumption, pump & valve integration, pump & bags integration and maybe even more. It will also be important to check how well the pump responds to being stored at low temperatures and then being asked to turn on as this will be required during flight. As TUBULAR doesn't collect any data during the 2 hour floating phase our pump could get quite chilly if we are not careful. We have been warned by the manufacturers that if we let the pump cool too much we could have startup problems as the plastic diaphragm may be too cold to move. But not to worry, our thermal team are on the case to make sure that this delicate flower is well looked after. 

post-par$: Until next time ^-^
