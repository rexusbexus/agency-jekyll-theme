post-par1: Yesterday was a sad day for a football fangirl like me because both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are out from this FIFA World Cup. I’m both heartbroken and sad. All I can say the winner team was indeed better and had also the luck on theirs side. The majority of the supporters are assuming that this may be the last World cup for those two legends and I fear it might be true. But on the bright side, somehow the swedish team manage to move on to the knockout phase, which I was pretty surprised over. Let’s hope they won’t be stuck at this phase! HEJA SVERIGE!

post-par2: On the other hand, regarding the TUBULAR project, we are still stuck at this boring waiting phase. The Swagelok fittings are estimated to be arriving next week, which means we can SOOOOOON start building the pneumatic system. But before that we also need to wait for the stainless steel tube to arrive.... so that means we can still keep watching the World Cup before the serious building session starts.

post-par3: For those who doesn’t watch the World Cup, enjoy your summer to maximum! =)
