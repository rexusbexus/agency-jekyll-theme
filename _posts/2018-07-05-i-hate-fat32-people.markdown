post-par1:I hate FAT32, there I said it... Wooh, it feels nice to get that off my chest. Before you judge me let me explain my opinion with one simple statement. In the world of filsystems, not all of them are created equal. FAT32 is not a good filsystem period. Why on Earth does the SD association continue to make FAT the recommended file system for SDcards? FAT32 (and FAT16) can't even save files larger than 4GiB. Dial-up modem screeching, whats this? The ninties are sending us an electronic mail to us. They want their shitty filesystem back.

post-par2:In today world we have new filesystems that allows us to save larger files. Features like journaling gives us better corruption resistant memorys. Things like this are standard in modern filesystems. Yet you have FAT that lingers as an old horse begging to be put out of it's misery.

post-par3:Please join me in abolishing FAT, spread the word so our children may never see FAT and the horror it brings.
