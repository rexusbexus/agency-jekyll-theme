post-par1: The recovery team drove around 860 km to recover our AirCore. They had to hike 5 km through the forest in order to get to it it so 10 km in total. It took around 13 hours to recover it by car and by foot. A big thank you to the recovery team lead by Stefan Krämer from the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC).

post-par2: Since we closed the valve at 6.5 km altitude, we expected the pressure inside the coil to be 440 mBar, but when we got it back we found it was at sea level pressure. This could have meant one of two things - 1) the valve never opened and the AirCore was still full of fill gas 2) there was a leak through the valve. 

post-par3: After plugging it in, there was a moment where it was fill gas and then suddenly the CO concentration dropped dramatically indicating that we had stratospheric air! What a relief, we have something! The tropospheric samples are questionable but the stratospheric samples are very good. The stratospheric air samples have been stored in 15 pieces of tubing FMI brought with them so that they may later run further analysis.

post-par4: What about our other sampling system, the one with the bags? Alas, it suffered from a component failure with the air pump. We mitigated by switching to manual mode and sending valve commands for passive sampling. We haven't recovered this part of the experiment yet. I must say, it was quite amazing how the team handled the malfunction as it unfolded and came up with a new plan. Telecommanding is super cool. Stay tuned to find out if it actually worked!
