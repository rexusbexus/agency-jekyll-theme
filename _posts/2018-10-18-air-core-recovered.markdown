post-par1: Sampling with the AirCore happened nominally and this is awesome.

post-par2: Sampling with the bags suffered component failure with the air pump. We mitigated by switching to manual mode and sending valve commands for passive sampling. Time will tell if this actually worked. Eager to find out.

post-par3: Quick revovery with helicopter was cancelled due to the weather. This is not ideal but it's not terrible either, the AirCore was recovered by car instead.

post-par4: After running it in the piccarro analyser for a few minutes we finally saw data on the collected stratospheric air samples. Looking forward to further analysis. Stay tuned.
