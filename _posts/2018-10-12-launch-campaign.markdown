post-par1: Ladies and Gentlemen, its the captain speaking. Welcome on board! There will be some final preparations before we take off. Fill the balloon, fasten you seatbelts, people WE ARE FLYING! 

post-par2: (Serious me now). Friday evening already, which means that the launch campaing is about to start! Only a few hours far! Four team members and I, arrived today at Esrange where we will do some final testing with our experiment and the gondola. Next step is the flushing of the AAC and CAC systems. On Wednesday we will have our first chance to fly if the weather allows it. And pretty much, these are our launch campaign days.  

post-par3: Earlier today, our partners from FMI arrived at space campus in Kiruna! They brought the Aircore and all the necessary equipment for the data analysis. Mechanical team, put the Aircore in its box while other team members were packing the tools and things we are going to need. There was a checklist around, to make sure we won't forget anything. And off we go!     

post-par4: Now, after a looong day, some sleep FINALLY! AAC, CAC systems are sharing a room, like Natalie and I, and Emil and Pau. The Picarro analyzer is in a single room like Ansyar. Tomorrow, the whole team will be here for the safety briefing which is mandatory for anyone who wants to be here at the launch day. We will try our best to keep you updated. Goodnight!
