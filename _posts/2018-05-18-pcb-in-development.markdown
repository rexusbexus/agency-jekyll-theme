post-par1: Hi everyone, the new kid Electric Emil here. Joining a BEXUS project proved more challenging than what I thought. Although, this might be due to that the SED 2.0 was due five days from when I joined.

post-par2: I really got thrown in during, wat seems to me like, the most hectic time possible. This forced me to get engaged quickly and start digging which was really helpful since it forced me to learn. As soon as I had a small understanding of what the project was I mediately started on the fun part (designing an electrical control system), together with the rest of the electrical team members. Believe it or not, the most challenging part was figuring out how diodes work at 1AM on a Saturday.
post-par3: After the SED, the task of designing the PCB landed on my shoulders. I’m really excited about this since I never done this before and I wanted to learn about this. For now, the schematics should be redesigned a bit to only contain the components that should be placed on the PCB. We are using Autodesk’s Eagle software to make this process as simple as possible. Once the rearrangements are done designing the PCB SHOULD be easy... Should...
post-par4: To finish my first blogpost, I just want to thank every in the TUBULAR for welcoming me with open arms into this project. I’m looking forward to getting to know you better and to work with you for the coming months. And that’s it for this blog post, as we say in Gothenburg, Ha de gött.
