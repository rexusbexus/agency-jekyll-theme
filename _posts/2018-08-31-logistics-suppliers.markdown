post-par1: Imagine this situation, it is two weeks until the trip to the Finnish Meteorological Institute (a one-time chance to carry out a set of multisystem integration tests for 5 days), we start working with the pump tubing for the level 1 of our pneumatic system and a question arise. Are these plastic fittings (the ones that came by default with the pump) good enough to ensure a proper sealing?

post-par2: Red lights on, email pump supplier, email FMI, email anyone that could get any insight about the situation, cry, pray, stress, two weeks (that fittings were literally dancing over the plastic tubes).

post-par3: The days pass by, answers arrive, solutions appear, and decisions are taken. We need to order extra metal fittings, wait for the shipping to arrive here, in Kiruna (the bottom of the world), and hope they will fit properly. Oh wait! But these extra fittings will make the pump bigger, will this affect the distribution of the elements inside the structure? Yes, of course, the space was designed for a specific situation. PANIC. Distribution changes, fittings changes, new stuff required. Then, is when you realise how much important are good allies to achieve success in a project.

post-par4: Sometimes, very small details that you couldnâ€™t foresee cause a ripple effect all over the experiment that may become into big changes and many hours of work. Now, it is one week until the Global testing in FMI, all the components arrived safe and sound and, as you could see in the picture, everything fits perfect!! Thank you very much to Swagelok, our suppliers for all the pneumatic fittings, for all their patience and support, and specially for their efficiency in providing solutions under pressure and with very tight timings.
