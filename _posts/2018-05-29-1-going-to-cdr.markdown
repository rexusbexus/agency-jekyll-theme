post-par1: Hello, Erik from Thermal is back with a special two part blogg! Because my memory is that of a goldfish sometime, very efficient but short. I will be giving you two blog post today to compensate for my blunder and forgetting it yesterday, disappointing you, our readers. 
 
post-par2: Now we are close to CDR (two days left woop woop) and we are going there confident to present and to astonish the panel. Our dear electrical team have gone ahead to scout out and start prepare and tomorrow (wednesday) the rest of us will join them. Then thursday we will give our presentation showing our hard work and how amazing TUBULAR will become when built.
 
post-par3: Last friday we had a mock presentation where we invited students and teachers to come listen and give a lot of feedback so we can prepare and improve even more. The last days since then have been all about fixing, preparing and practice. Even if the school is soon over and summer will come it is to go all in for this CDR to ace it.

post-par4: We have had our last meeting as a whole groupe as well before the summer because soon people will go away for summer and it is not until the Autumn that we all will be back again. The meeting ended with a new TUBULAR group photo with all the new members included. Time to sign off and go back to practice to get this CDR presentation done and the best it can be until next time!
