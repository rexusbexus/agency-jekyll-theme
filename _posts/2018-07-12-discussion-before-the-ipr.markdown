post-par1: Hello again, good readers! Having since safely returned from Sardinia, I am back on the grid. Let’s see what has happened recently…

post-par2: Yesterday was when we had as group TUBULAR agreed for there to be an appointment with our mentors - and boy oh boy could it not have come soon enough! The PCB and inline pressure sensor were the only two components not yet in our possession - the PCB having not yet been ordered. The schematics are what will be due very soon, and they can still be done with a rough estimation of the PCB in mind, as the big picture is going to be far more important during the presentation. The meeting itself involved PM Natalie, and everyone not currently present in Kiruna, as those who were would likely be busy directly building the experiment.

post-par3: But other than this concern about electrical plans and layouts, the other divisions are still managing to hold out without too much lag, so the deadlines should be met. As a collective group, I think we can really pull this off!
