post-par1: Hello again, good readers! Having since safely returned from Sardinia, I am back on the grid. Let’s see what has happened recently…

post-par2: Yesterday was when we had as group TUBULAR agreed for there to be an appointment with our mentors - and boy oh boy could it not have come soon enough! To summarise, we are missing the PCB we ordered, as it still has not arrived, while much of the continued work in Team Electrical depends on the knowledge of exactly how this product will fit into the experiment (in a figurative and in a physical sense). The electrical schematics are what are primarily thrown into jeopardy by this - that is, if they are to be submitted within the newly-assigned deadline. The schematics can, however still be done with a rough estimation of the PCB in mind, as the big picture is going to be far more important once the presentation is upon my fellows still up in Kiruna. That’s the other thing by the way - the idea behind this talk was that it would primarily circle around those of us not currently part of the active building process - so each one of us that attended to report our team’s progress was calling from a different room in a different country!

post-par3: But other than this concern about electrical plans and layouts, the other divisions are still managing to hold out without too much lag, so the deadlines should be met. As a collective group, I think we can really pull this off!
