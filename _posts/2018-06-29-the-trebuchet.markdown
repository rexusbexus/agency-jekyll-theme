post-par1: Welcome back, good readers! Now, I am writing to you from Alghero, a port town on the western side of Sardinia. Since just after the point when I last posted, I have been off the grid for nearly the entire time, having only turned on my phone a couple of days ago to read up on the group chats to make sure I was not personally needed. Because of my current passive position, nothing BEXUS-related has happened on my end, but a great deal is happening back in Sweden (I assume)! At this moment, the building phase is in motion, and the mechanical team is actively taking in all of the considerations from every other department in our group - especially team thermal.

post-par2: Because team mechanical will be closely working with us at this point, I feel now is an especially important time to send some recognition in their direction in the form of this beautiful device I came across facing out toward the Mediterranean Sea. This trebuchet is an example of some of the earliest long-range ballistic warfare devices that was used in Europe. We had at one point passed a church whose construction dated back 900 years ago, meaning that this town would likely be at least around the same age, if not older. That could make this particular weapon nearly 1000 years old! All this talk of early warfare when I was just on about sending praise - but the real beauty here is in its design and operation, rather than its history. This is quite literally an elevated teeter-totter with baskets on both of the shaft’s ends. It was developed so that once a projectile is prepped for launch in the extended basket, that a substantially heavier weight would then be released into the inner main basket, causing the shaft connecting the two to swing the smaller of the weights up and over the device. From there, the projectile would be released in the direction the trebuchet was facing - and any enemy in its path. I am sure that when this structure was invented, there was a similar mechanical team at work - and their contribution really speaks for itself!

post-par3: Oh yeah, and apparently, Alghero was also inhabited by a Catalan population, so there are still elements of the culture present in this otherwise Italian island - including a TV channel!
