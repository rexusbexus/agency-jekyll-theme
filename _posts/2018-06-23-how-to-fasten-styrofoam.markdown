post-par1: Summer, summer, summer they say. Well except a short evening with above 10 degrees it has been raining the whole week. I am hoping the team members that have left Kiruna might have seen the sun and can share it. 

post-par2: What to do except dress properly. Layer upon layer of clothes. That we shall do with the experiment to keep it warm, aluminum and Styrofoam to keep the inside safe from the harsh Kiruna outside.

post-par3: The last week it has been discussion how to fasten the Styrofoam. Some of the ideas is to use plastic screws from the outside, have 90 degrees angles on the inside from the frame to make a slot for the Styrofoam and lastly use thread from the frame on the inside tying it stuck.

post-par4: What sounds the best in keeping it in place and not any holes in the styrofoam to have heatbridges to the outside. As seen in the picture we are tying it to the fram! Well that was the latest news from thermal, keep it cool!
