post-par1: Hej hej hej, it's Georges and he is time warping into the pandemic blog posting future of 2021. Hello, this has been quite a trip. Wow! This update is long overdue but here it is. Better late than never, amiright?

post-par2: First thing's first, we never did do a reflight of the experiment because things didn't work out in that direction in the end. However, the super duper neat (late) news is that we did publish our findings in not just one but two conference papers!

post-par3: Read all about it in the proceedings for the 24th ESA Symposium on European Rocket & Balloon Programmes and Related Research (October 2019) and the 3rd Symposium on Space Educational Activities (April 2020).  

post-par4: Links to the papers are on the top of the landing page. Still waiting for those elusive citations, though! Alright folks, I'm pretty sure this is the last update. It was a pleasure. Thank you all for your support, peace out!
