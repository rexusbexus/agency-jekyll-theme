post-par1: Hello again, good readers! I start this post with a round of applause for my mates back up in Kiruna who just earlier this week endured the IPR! With it being Wednesday as I write this, we have passed it. But did we pass it - that’s the question. The presentation is now history, but what of its implications? Well, a couple of authors before me say there is a hint of good news in the air, so no sense in repeating what they said. We can hope for that pass however - let’s hope.

post-par2: But aside from that, I also read from other authors that the tests and construction are coming along quite well. Before the presentation this week, we each had our revision tasks for the SED, and I learned how to configure PDFs within a PDF. No joke, I never did this before, so there was some fun in that novelty. Of course with LaTeX, we also had to deal with correctly coded footnotes displaying incorrectly.

post-par3: But now, we are drawing ever closer to the final leg of the mission before launch - where we will all be back in September working around the clock! Considering how we may be so busy then, I take a moment every few nights to gaze at the night sky through my telescope and enjoy the slow-moving sights of our galaxy.
