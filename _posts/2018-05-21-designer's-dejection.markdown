post-par1: Hello again, good readers! SED 2.0 is in and we don’t ever have to worry about it again! Well, at least not that exact number indicative of our progress (measured on a scale from 0.0 to 5.0 and hopefully ending there). The delusion was good for the 30 seconds it took me to come up with that statement anyway… So, with the 40-MB-and-then-some-PDF having been sent in, now it is up to those of us not preparing for the CDR presentation to help those that are! In my case, I will probably soon have to help the other half of Team Thermal organize his speech points and maybe give him some neatly written cue cards!

post-par2: But this post is going to be a break from the thermodynamics references and deity-awful puns bound to come with them. This is not an entry from this guy writing as a thermal engineer. This is a transcribed log from the guy who originally worked on the TUBULAR logo you now see whenever you visit us. You see, if this post’s preview and main images strike you readers with any sense of familiarity, it might be because they depict my final draft of the product - how it was originally supposed to appear. Now, I did just use the words “original(ly)” and “final” in the same sentence, having them regard the same subject. This is where my contribution ended, and the successful elements from this were taken and accompanied by a few new decorations - that would become the molecules and stars that replace the mountains and clouds that can be seen in the background and periphery! This was TUBULAR’s final decision. The credit to the newer elements goes to a helpful friend of the soon-to-be new project manager of our group. It’s fair game whether the integration of the two ideas to form our final logo was also his doing, or the doing of the future manager herself! I don’t remember.

post-par3: I do remember now, that I had some regrets about submitting my design the way I did. I should have taken the hint at the time that the 80’s feel was meant to be a very loose guideline for the art style - and not the very core foundation of image’s appearance. The fluorescence of the outlines and the metallic luster of the letters just took this in the wrong direction, and I see why the true final change was made. What saddens me though is knowing how far this design was changed once outside of my grasp - and that now it too, no longer represents us entirely. At least one of the gases we originally intended to sample will no longer be being featured in our experiment, making some of the molecules included in the insignia redundant. If we had seen this coming sooner, I could have at least pressed the rest of TUBULAR at the time to remove them and expand the letters to the size seen in my original version. Maybe then, we’d be on the right track for good. And maybe then, people wouldn’t dwell so much on what the heck those letters are supposed to spell either.
