post-par1: Hi all! Emil back to doing blogposts again!

post-par2: As you might have understod by Natalies post, the project is on most parts quite calm with a lot of waiting to sitt through at the moment. We are currently waiting for all the products that has been orderd to arive so that we can start building.

post-par3: I don't know about you but for me atleast there is something extreamly satisfying about opening boxes that comes with the mail. For me this sometimes leads to some unhealthy amount of internet shoping of unnecessary things just to have packages to open. But luckily for me there will soon be a big splashdown of components ariving and it will feel like christmas again!

post-par4: As soon as all these components arive life will(finaly) get hectic again! No more chill! No more spare time! Im looking forward to it! You should probably remind me that i typed these words when im tierd of building. Talking about being tierd of doing things, im now tiered of this blogpost(i might have a short attention span) so i will leave you with this. Ha de g√∂tt!
