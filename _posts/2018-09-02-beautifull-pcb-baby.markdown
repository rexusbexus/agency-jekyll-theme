post-par1: Hej! Emil here again. It's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Today is the last day before the FMI trip and we are finalising and making sure that everything is ready for the test in the coming week.

post-par2: Lucky me, being electrical I got to work with beautiful pcb's a lot and you can see from the image that it looks beautiful! This is all thanks to our great partners at Eurocurcuit who decided to sponsor our PCB's! Thanks guys! It really helped us a lot!

post-par3: Usually, when you design PCB's and you send them to a manufacturer you have to provide gerber files for the manufacturer. For someone who just designed their first pcb this can be a bit tricky. But manufacturing with Eurocircuits is super easy since you can just upload your Eagle files, set your pcb thickness and BAM, you are done, ready for manufacturing. Super easy!

post-par4: Now there is only 4.5 hours until I leave for Finland and every minute that is saved I get one more minute of sleep and again thanks to Eurocircuits I at least got 2 extra days of sleep! Now, back to making sure the experiment works. Until next time, Ha de g√∂tt!
