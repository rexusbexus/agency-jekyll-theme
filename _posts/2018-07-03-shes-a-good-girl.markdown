post-par1: Hej people, Georges here introducing you to Team TUBULAR's most important member. Her name is Fika and she's the goodest mascot, yes she is!

post-par2: Fika is a rescue mascot, I found her abandonned next to some garbage containers in downtown Kiruna. Twas early Spring, I remember that fateful day as if it were yesterday.

post-par3: The cruelty of her previous owners is unforgivable, shame on them! But worry not, she's all healed now, both physically as well as emotionally, and now has a loving home at our Space Campus workshop where Team TUBULAR has been tending to all her needs with unprecedented love! 

post-par4: Thank you for your love, Fika. We love you.
