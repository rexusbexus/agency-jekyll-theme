post-par1: Hi all! Emil back to doing blogposts again!

post-par2: If you read my last blogpost, you might now that I was eagerly waiting for the components that we ordered to arrive. Well, now they have finally arrived! At least some of them and we can finally start testing!

post-par3: I don't know if we have mentioned it in previous posts but one of the concerns in the electrical system was the power supply. We are using two dc to dc converters in parallel which was the source of some concerned since it was not obvious that it would work.

post-par4: Now that we finally got the dc to dc converters it was one of the first things we decided to test. Luckily the first test confirms that is works! Yay! Now there is just all the other tests left to do which hopefully will come back with the same results. Until next time, Ha de g√∂tt!
