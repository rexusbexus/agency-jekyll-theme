post-par1: Hello from Indonesia!! It's me Ansyar, the most handsome South East Asian person in Kiruna. (kidding lol)

post-par2: If you guys follow our previous posts, you will notice that most of our members are in Kiruna this summer (including me). So, how do we continue the work?

post-par3: In software team, we keep in touch using social media, such as Whatsapp or FB. When Gustav wants to do some software test or validation, he will notify me and i will also join via skype or WA call. Therefore, I can also contribute in solving problem that might arise. FYI, we are gonna do some validation tomorrow or day after tomorrow. So, let's see if we can manage to do live video call during the validation.

post-par4: That's it for today post. See you next time!!
