post-par1: Tjenixen, second post of the day. As I said in the last post. My sloppiness gave me the opportunity to write to you twice today! Personally, I don’t think it’s a punishment. Well, I’ve had worse punishments at least.

post-par2: So, what could I possibly prattle on about in this post? Let’s talk Electronics!  So, what’s new? Recently we have been working hard to get everything done for the CDR. Mostly locking down part’s and finishing up the PCB on my part. As we are reviewing all the parts for a last time, of course there are always going to be something that we will stumble upon that needs and extra work.

post-par3: Luckily, we had the ask an expert session before the CDR presentation which gave us a lot of good input. Now we just need to put this input into work and finalize all the small details that are left until we can start ordering, testing and soldering inside the workshop all summer.

post-par4: As a finisher of the second post of today I’d like to wish you all a good summer and I hope you will stay on top of our blog during the summer as well! Ha de gött!
