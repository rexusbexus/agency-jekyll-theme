post-par1: Good news, good news, good news!! We finally received our structure bars from Bosch Rexroth that we ordered two weeks ago. More items from them are also coming within these fews weeks. It is also planned that we will soon go out to town and buy the aluminum sheet and styrofoam that will be our walls in our experiment.

post-par2: As mentioned in my previous post, I’m kinda the sponsor hunter in TUBULAR. The best deal offer we got from Bosch Rexroth was a total 45% off from the normal prices. Thanks to this huge discounting we can now afford to buy spare materials such as one more the stainless steel sulfinert treated tubing.

post-par3: It feels so good that some real action are finally happening after spending 2395843710 hours just to look for these components. We can soon start with the building session (which is what we planned for a looooooooong time ago). It will be both filled with exciting and challenging moments since it will be our first time to apply our idea and knowledge into the reality. As you may already know, the majority of the team members already started returning to theirs hometown for the summer vacation, which means the rest will be formed as the building group (and I am one of them hehehehe). I really hope everything will go smoothly and as planned but as mostly people say “ We don’t grow when things are easy, we grow when we face challenges”. Therefor challenge accepted! \(^o^)/
