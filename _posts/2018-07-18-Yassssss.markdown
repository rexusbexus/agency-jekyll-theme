post-par1: One of our most awaited component is finally here! Today we received the stainless steel tube from SilcoTek that we have been longed for a looooooooooooong time. At first we thought it will come at the end of this week or be delayed to the IPR week ( if we were super unlucky). But it surprisingly turned up today and made the situation much better for us to prepare for the IPR which is next Monday. 
post-par2: This means we can now officially start building the pneumatic system and connect the tube to the sponsored Swagelok fittings. 
post-par3: Let the fun begin! \(^-^)/
