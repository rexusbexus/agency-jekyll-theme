post-par1: Hello people or as you would say in Greek, geia sas! Almost two weeks ago, I left Kiruna to come home with a bittersweet feeling as I told you but at the end, it feels so nice to be back home!

post-par2: The only thing that gave me hard time was the temperature. From the cold Kiruna with 6 degrees to the boiling Kreta with 35 degrees! So, as you can imagine I spend most of my day at the beach and most of my nights strolling around with friends! 

post-par3: In BEXUS news, there is some SED polishing to do. At home or at the beach, it doesn't matter as soon as you get some work done.

post-par4: For the team members back in Kiruna, who are doing a great job building the experiment and making the last orders, don't listen to me.. It's all lies! It's terrible here.. TOO HOT! I would rather be there with you! luv u all <3
