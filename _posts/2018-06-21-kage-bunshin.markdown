post-par1: Hi all, I’m delighted to introduce you our new half-member of the team, Idroj. I flew back home two days ago, but since IPR is around the corner I felt the duty to not completely abandon my mates in Kiruna while I am enjoying Catalan beaches and mountains. In the picture you can see how mad he became when I told him I was leaving home without him. 

post-par2: I would like to say that my skills in duplicate myself are a bit in lack of use, but he is completely functional. Apparently, he has been struggling with thermal members about how to avoid the heat bridges of our experiment with the gondola and how to attach the insulation Styrofoam to the structure. Ropes, screws, Velcro, glue …  many options seem to be on the table but only one will be the winner. Wait until the next episode to read about the updates in the subject! 

post-par3: Damn, I really hope his head doesn’t explode after that much work he is doing.
