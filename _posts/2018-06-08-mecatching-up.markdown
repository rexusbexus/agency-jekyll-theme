post-par1: Hello all, it’s been a while since you don’t read any serious blog about mechanics and the structure of our child, so maybe it’s a good time to make a review to catch up and explain you a bit about what’s going on. Otherwise you may think we are all day messing around and whether that was true, no one should know so let this be our secret.

post-par2: In the last episode, we were still working on computer analysis software stuff checking that the structure would stand all the loads of the flight. Since then many days have passed (at least in the calendar, you know the psycho-Sun here in Kiruna doesn’t give a shit if you want to sleep sometimes), and we moved on to hands-on work. Without going any further, two days ago the mechanical team resistance did a wonderful tour across some local Kiruna companies to order some of the components for the structure, namely the aluminium walls and the insulation styrofoam.

post-par3: Moreover (another secret that must stay here), we were that sure about our design that we ordered most of the structure components before the CDR! Luckily, we got a super PASS and only minor changes had to be implemented, so we are on track.

post-par4: Finally, I don’t want to say bye without thank Bosch Rexroth for that super cool 45% discount they gave us! By now I’m just waiting for the components to arrive while looking for a Master Thesis topic/Internship/opportunity. If any reader is interested, you can contact me whenever you want through my email (jordicoll.28@gmail.com) or clicking in my name down here. I’m a great engineer, you won’t be disappointed!
