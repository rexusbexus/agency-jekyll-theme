post-par1: So summer has come and gone and so our time is coming to and end to get it done. Since last I have been working on the styrofoam and cutting out all the walls and inside.

post-par2: Now I am working on attaching the aluminum walls and styrofoam so we can remove the walls with the styrofoam. At the moment the CAC is very close done and ready for FMI.

post-par3: Thermal wise we have good news that we can test the FMI thermal chamber to see how well it works in cold enviroment.

post-par4: Stay tuned for more updates on the building from me, until next time!
