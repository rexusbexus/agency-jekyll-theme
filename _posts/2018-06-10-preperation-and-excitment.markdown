post-par1: Hej, Erik from thermal here again. After a week of vacation from BEXUS until the feedback had arrived it is time to start again. For us in thermal we managed pretty well with only suggestions to look into and possible improve.Some of the tasks will be identifying hotspots, look into if we shall paint the experiment, see what heatbridges there is and how it will affect.

post-par2: So for now we have a little to do before the IPR, nothing that we can not handle. Hopefully things will start to arrive soon and I am way to excited to start building. It is the most fun part, after spending months preparing, calculating, designing and simulating to finally build.

post-par3: Other than BEXUS will I do something fun vacation wise? Ofc! I will be working as most of the other members that stays in Kiruna this summer. Will be spending my time at Esrange working, fun part about being there is I can see the launch pad where we will be releasing our experiment in october. I am just getting more excited about that it shall soon be us standing there launching.

post-par4: Have a nice summer and as you can see in this image summer is over in Kiruna or shall start were confusing when walking to the buss this last thursday (7/6). Until next time stay cool!
