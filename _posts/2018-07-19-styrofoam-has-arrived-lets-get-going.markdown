post-par1: Hello Erik is back with some fun thermal news.

post-par2: This week the styrofoam have been bought and tested. First now that the styrofoam is here I can start with manufacturing of the walls. Soon the IPR and what else to work hard and produce something good to present.

post-par3: As well the Styrofoam have been vacuum tested. A 10x10x5cm piece were put in the vacuum test chamber and brought down to 5hPa for 5min. It had not expanded or contracted and that is a good result. One more test will be done for a longer while so we can confirme it works for a long time as well.

post-par4: Stay tuned for more updates later on how the work is going!
