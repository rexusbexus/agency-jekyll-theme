post-par1: Hi, Emil here. Today it the day before IPR and things are starting to fall in place. 
post-par2: In the electrical team we have spent a lot of time building the whole electronical system on breadboards to be able to show that the component will work as expected. Very soon after we begun building we ran out of breadboards to build on. Luckily there were more to be found!
post-par3: After we built some of the parts of the electronical system we of course tested them. But to test electronics you usually need electricity which was not that easy to find and LTU today during some hours. Unlucky us had a lightning storm over our heads which struck out all power at LTU for a few hours.
post-par4: Luckily the power came back, and the testing could continue, in a somewhat cleaner lab. Right now, the state of the electronics feels good for tomorrows IPR and we can rest peacefully. Until next time, Ha de g√∂tt!
