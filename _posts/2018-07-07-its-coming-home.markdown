post-par1: This week has been a week filled with good news, not only have all of our parts started to arrive in Kiruna but England have been winning the football for once ^0^ Next up we face Crotia on the day I arrive back to Kiruna. Who knows if we can win but its been a fun ride.

post-par2: Now that everything has started to arrive the next phase of the project truly begins. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is building but before we all get carried away with excitement at piecing TUBULAR together we can't forget we have to test everything every step of the way.

post-par3: Luckily we already have some vacuum testing secured so we can check out our valves, sensors and arduino in low pressure as well as the pump. Hopefully this testing will go jsut as well as our initial pump vacuum testing and everything will work as planned. But if it doesn't by testing early we have left plenty of time to make things work!

post-par4: To hijack the England song for TUBULAR; Three gases to find, we'll send our box flying. Combining our minds, until we get it working. So lets hope that all the TUBULAR parts arrive home in Kiruna soon and that the football arrives home in England too!
