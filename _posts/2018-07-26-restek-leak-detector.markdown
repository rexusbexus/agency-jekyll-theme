post-par1: Hej guys, you know what would be tragic? If we let a small leak in our pneumatic and tubing system completely ruin our sampling. Imagine going through the year long effort of designing and building our experiment only to have the mission fail because of a tiny leak!

post-par2: But worry not, the folks over at Restek have got us covered and have graciously sponsored us with one of their Electronic Leak Detector!

post-par3: This is such a fantastic tool that will greatly help us augment the robustness of our experiment and give us absolute confidence that it is leak free and launch ready. Notable features are an audible tone that indicates the severity of a leak, circuitry offering 12 hours of operation between charges, and the ability to detect a broad range of gases - ex rated for use with hydrogen and other explosive gases.

post-par4: A big thank you to Restek!
