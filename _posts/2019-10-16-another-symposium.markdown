post-par1: Hi guys, guess who's back? Georges is blog posting again for an update on more symposium adventures which took place on September 16-18. This blog post is a month late, I know!

post-par2: This time around we had Pau present TUBULAR at the 3rd Symposium on Space Educational Activities in Leicester, UK. Needless to say, he had a great time!

post-par3: As was the case for Erik during the 24th ESA Symposium, many participants encouraged us to go through with a re-flight in order to validate the AAC sampling system (that's the one with the bags, remember?). It's a great motivator to see so many people excited about our experiment even if it's been a while since we launched. One exciting outcome of these two symposiums are the research papers that we will publish, stay tuned!  

post-par4: What about the reflight with FMI, you ask? We are now targetting July 2020. This may seem far away but I'm pretty sure that the months will fly by in a blink of an eye.
